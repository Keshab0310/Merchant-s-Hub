## Merchant's Hub

The name of this console app is mentioned in the title and its name is Merchant's Hub. This console app has 3 options in the front which include Root of Merchant hub, Retrieving Data, and Exit.

## Root of Merchant Hub

It displays the options that give access to the control of the database where we can add, update, or remove any data inside the database.

## There are 6 options such as !!🫵
1. Customer Management
2. Merchant Management
3. Account Management
4. Product and Service Management
5. Purchase Management
6. Transaction Management

### ☝️☝️ The above Options have different sub-options where we can modify each option by adding, updating, or removing the data in each department.

## Retrieving Data📑
Similarly, the second option is Retrieving data, here user can view and search for customer, merchant, and account information in the database. 🔏

### There are only 3 options, they are: 
-Beginner Level Data -Intermediate Level Data -Advanced Layered Data In this model, I have only made 10 queries for each option, where the user can easily calculate the lists of any data without any errors and the user can be able to view the represented outputs too. This feature allows the user to effectively look out for data contained in the database.

# Feature of Merchant’s Hubs Console app: 
This app is particularly beneficial in every way. But Data Auditing and Reporting can be the major feature of this app. My group as a whole is planning to make this app which provides more comprehensive auditing and Reporting capabilities while enabling the users to analyze trends, monitor performance, and make data-driven decisions
